Kenny Anderson scored 34 points and made two free throws with one second left to send the game into overtime after Puerto Rico led by 8 points with 1 minute 34 seconds to play in the second half . Yugoslavia , which beat the United States in the semifinals , will face the Soviet Union for the gold medal today . This was the fourth straight international tournament in which the United States had failed to win a gold . Any medal for the United States looked out of the question with 1:34 left in regulation when Raymond Gausse 's 3-pointer gave Puerto Rico a 96-88 lead . Then Anderson hit a jumper with 1:21 to play to get the United States within 6 , and Puerto Rico opted for possession rather than foul shots four times in the final 1:19 . After a backcourt violation , Anderson made two free throws with 51 seconds left . Todd Day scored 14 seconds later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Puerto Rico turnover . Jose Ortiz , who had 25 points and 11 rebounds , tried to inbound the ball , but overthrew Federico Lopez , and the Americans had possession and a chance for their third comeback victory in the tournament .

Benn knocked down Barkley three times in the first round , ending the bout under Nevada rules . The end came at 2:57 . There was momentary confusion , however , over whether the bout was over .

            "@@3000341  In the airy sitting room of the ranch house where he has lived for 48 years , Byron Nelson holds a picture in his gnarled hands and peers back through time . In the frame , a lean young man is in the perfect golf position , his arms extended and the shaft of his club bowed , head behind the ball , body in absolute balance .  Nelson 's gaze lingers on the frame , and the deep lines of his face are reflected in the glass . He is the man with the tie and the starched shirt in the old black-and-white photo , swinging with a tensile strength that fairly leaps through the decades and out of the picture ; he is the man with the bad hip sitting with his cane at arm 's length . He shakes his head slowly , puts a finger to his lips and smiles .  \" I do n't know about you , \" he says in a voice strong and full of Texas , \" but I do n't see anything at all wrong with that swing . \"  Not that Byron Nelson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing this 83-year-old man would do . It 's not his style . This is about substance . This is the golf swing that inspired the United States Golf Association to name its driving robot \" Iron Byron . \" It is the swing that produced 52 United States tournament victories in an abbreviated career . And it is the swing that , 50 years ago , launched Nelson on the most remarkable streak in the history of this , and perhaps any other , sport .  With this swing , Byron Nelson won 11 straight golf tournaments in 1945 . Eleven straight . It has never been approached . The closest any golfer has come was Jackie Burke Jr. , who won four straight back in 1952 . And with this golden anniversary of Nelson 's unprecedented achievement , the spotlight once again has focused on this quiet man from Fort Worth . During the months and weeks leading up to this weekend 's GTE Byron Nelson Classic at the Four Seasons Resort at Las Colinas , Nelson figures he has done many more interviews than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that I 'm complaining , \" he said . \" It still amazes me . Can you imagine ? All this about something a man did 50 years ago ? But I 've enjoyed it , enjoyed thinking about it and talking about it . \"  Nelson 's eyes are clear and his hands -- those huge , calloused hands that made golf grips look like pencils -- are steady . People used to say the hands are what gave him so much control , what enabled him to keep the club on line longer than anyone before or since . No telling . But during one day recently , he signed 1,520 advance copies of his \" Little Black Book , \" a fascinating compendium of his notes beginning with the 1935 season , and the signature never varied .  Consistency has always been Nelson 's hallmark . Some of the numbers from his career seem unreal . During one stretch in the 1940 's , he made 113 straight cuts around the world , a record that still stands . His career lasted just 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 victories . They are Sam Snead ( 81 ) , Jack Nicklaus ( 70 ) , Ben Hogan ( 63 ) and Arnold Palmer ( 60 ) . And only Nicklaus was able to approach the number of tournament victories in the United States during his first 11 years on tour . Nicklaus won 51 in that stretch .  As impressive as those figures are , they pale next to those from the Streak . That year , Nelson not only won 11 straight . He won 18 of the 30 tournaments he entered . He finished second seven times and was out of the top five just once . His stroke average for the year was 68.33 , an all-time record and nearly a full stroke better than Snead 's second-place total of 69.23 . Maybe the most mind-boggling number of all is Nelson 's final-round stroke average . In crunch time , he shot an average score of 67.45 .  \" The final-round stroke average , that 's really the reason why I won so much as I did , \" he said . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snead did at Charlotte , when he bogeyed the last hole and then I won the playoff , that was a break . He could have scrambled around , gotten a par at the last hole and then that would have been the end of it . The whole streak would have stopped at one . \"  It all began uneventfully enough , with Byron and his running mate Jug McSpaden , the Gold Dust Twins , winning the Miami Four Ball by beating Denny Shute and Sam Byrd , 8 and 6 . Nothing unusual there . Nelson and McSpaden were a formidable team and played a lot of golf together since they both were rejected by the military during the war , Nelson for a blood problem and McSpaden for severe sinusitis .  One of the things to note about the first victory is the presence of Hogan in the field . Critics of Nelson 's accomplishments often point to what they say were war-depleted fields during the 1945 season . While it 's obviously true that some good players were off to war , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hogan played in 18 .  \" All of that talk about no competition never really bothered me , \" Byron said , \" because , you see , I know how I played . Maybe I would n't have won 18 tournaments , or 11 in a row , but I played wonderfully well . \"  He surely did . During the 11 victories that stretched from early March through early August , Nelson won by an average of seven strokes . There were only three real scares . The first was during tournament No. 2 at Charlotte , when Snead 's three-putt bogey at the last hole allowed Nelson to tie him at 272 and then defeat him after two 18-hole playoff rounds , 69-69 to 69-73 . The second scare came during victory No. 7 , in June at the Philadelphia Inquirer Invitation , when Nelson had to birdie five of the last six holes to shoot 63 and beat McSpaden by two strokes .  The third came in the second round of match play during the PGA Championship . That was when Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase that summed up the entire year . With just four holes to play at Moraine Country Club in Dayton , Ohio , Turnesa was 2 up on Nelson . His shot to the 15th hole was 10 feet from the hole , and he barely missed his birdie attempt . Nelson , whose shot was inside Turnesa 's , made his putt . Nelson then squared the match with a birdie at 16 , eagled the 17th to go 1 up and parred the last hole to protect his lead .  \" I was seven under and still lost , \" is what Turnesa said . \" How the hell are you supposed to beat this man ? \"  Five decades later , Nelson leans back in his chair and chuckles at that . He recalls that two weeks later , at Tam O'Shanter , he shot 269 to beat Hogan and Gene Sarazen by 11 strokes for his 10th straight victory .  \" I look back on it now , and it just seems like a good long dream , \" he said . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head for a period of a year and a half or so . But you know , the thing was , I consistently drove the ball in the fairway , and when you 're doing that , you 've got to be swinging well enough to put the ball on the green with your irons . \"  Always in the fairway . That was part of it . He has not been out of it since . After the following season , he retired from golf , at the age of 34 , because he had done everything he set out to do and he had made enough money to buy the ranch , 740 acres in the town about 15 miles outside Dallas . He and his first wife , Louise , who died in 1985 , had always wanted a place like that . He named it \" Fairway Ranch \" and he still lives there .  Byron Nelson tells you that he has no regrets about golf , and you believe him , because everything about his demeanor tells you so . Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete the career Grand Slam , but in those days it just cost too much to make the trip and he would have had to take a month off from his club job . He only made the crossing twice . No regret . Sure , if he had stayed in the game longer he would have won a lot more tournaments , \" but maybe then I would n't have gotten into television , would n't have had my name associated with my Byron Nelson Classic , you just never know . \" No regrets .  The only thing Nelson will admit to regretting is associating his name with a cigarette company back in 1936 . A devout man who to this day attends prayer meetings and church at the Hilltop Church of Christ , he never smoked , drank , chased women or stayed out late , something Snead still ribs him about . But he needed the money , and he took a $500 fee for endorsing a cigarette called 20 Grand . When the ads came out , the letters came in .  Pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \" None of us realizes how many people we influence , \" he said , \" and there had been a lot of nice articles written about me , about how I was a nice Christian man who did n't smoke or drink or do this or that , and suddenly this ad comes out and I started getting some of the most terrible letters from schoolteachers and Sunday school teachers . They said , ' Well , there you are , just like everybody else , letting the almighty dollar get to you . ' Five hundred dollars . I was sick about that . It was the worst thing I 've ever done . \"  He tried to give the money back , but the company refused . He says now he prayed about it \" many , many times , brought it to the good Lord and said I 'd never do anything again as long as I lived to influence people the wrong way . \"  Money has never been that important to Nelson . \" If I had made $10 million , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , \" he said . And he means it . It amuses him to think of how much money he would have made winning 18 tournaments last year -- it would have been somewhere in the $8 million range -- and he chuckles at the notion .  \" I could not be happier than I am , \" he said , and as he stands to put the photo on a nearby table , his major concession to age is evident . His walk is painfully slow , the result of hip-replacement surgery several years ago . He does n't get to play much golf anymore , but he will tell you , at the urging of his second wife , Peggy , whom he married in 1986 , about the 83 he shot a few weeks ago . The only thing troubling Nelson these days is the illness of Hogan , who is in a Fort Worth hospital recovering from colon surgery .  Although the two men grew up together , caddied together , competed and traveled together and had many meals together , Nelson has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he knows that Hogan does n't want company , and he respects his wishes . It still seems to pain him , though .  \" We are good friends and I understand the way he is , \" Nelson said . \" He has never been outgoing . I 've always respected his wishes about people leaving him alone . I 'm very concerned that he 's ill . \"  Nelson moves slowly into the family room of the ranch , where many of his trophies and memorabilia are displayed . He ca n't move like he once did , but his eye-hand coordination is still there . He is using a Cleveland Classic copy of his old McGregor driver as a cane , and as he walks he spots an ant scurrying across the floor . He gets it with the butt of the club on his first try .  Less than a week from this day , on the eve of the tournament that bears his name , Byron Nelson would stand in the Ben Crenshaw Suite at the Four Seasons , announcing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open at the resort in September and admiring the new Byron Nelson Eleven Straight Tournament Trophy , a silver loving cup designed by Tiffany &; Co . He was worn out , but enormously proud .  \" I feel like I 'm the luckiest man in golf , \" he would say . \" Not just because I have a few records attached to my name or anything like that . Just because of the way people have accepted me , wherever I 've gone , welcomed me . It has been a wonderful year , a wonderful year . \"  That it has . All because of a wonderful year , 50 years ago , a year that framed a feat that will never be duplicated and one that even the jaded golf professionals of today and the legions of golf fans recognize as something cosmic , otherworldly . As the sun sets over Texas and the cool of the evening comes to the Dallas suburbs , a pair of tourists sit at the feet of the giant Byron Nelson statue near the first tee and pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stops and turns to the copper image of Nelson . He salutes . It is a gesture that comes from generations of golfers , from all across time . \n",
            "@@3000641  It was just a normal summer day when Allan Houston stopped his workout in midchurn , stepped off the stationary bike and ducked into a film room at the Knicks ' practice facility .  Just once , he wanted to see it for himself . Not the highlight version , but the frame-by-frame account on a game film that rolled without announcers , color commentators or \" SportsCenter \" anchors to infringe on the delicate balance of the moment . Completely alone , Houston slipped in the videocassette marked Miami Game 5 : May 16 , 1999 , and watched himself calmly search for one shaft of light , one opening to part and flip up a one-handed runner that licked the rim , tapped the glass and fell through the net as gently as a droplet .  The pull of gravity . Through its force , the shot that hung in the air of Miami Arena -- and held the future of the Knicks ' franchise in suspense -- came down with eight-tenths of a second on the clock . At that instance , the Heat 's devastation became the Knicks ' salvation .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'll always keep with me , \" said Houston , who will be face to face with the Heat tonight at Madison Square Garden for the two rivals ' first meeting of the season . \" There was a lot riding on it . But I never think about that . I just think about the fact that we gave ourselves a chance . If you give yourself a chance , all you can do is make or miss . \"  Under extreme circumstances , the difference between the two can change everything . Something happened to Houston on the day he made what the Knicks refer to as the Shot . He does n't really see it , but then the modest Houston is n't the type to check out his reflection as he walks by a mirror .  If he did , he might notice what others do . The unassuming shooting guard who arrived in New York four years ago with his shoulders slumped , head down and a voice that rarely broke a whisper has been heard stirring up his teammates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes , you hear him and you say to yourself , ' Is that Allan ? ' \" Marcus Camby said . \" I have n't been around him all that long . But you can see the carry-over from the Shot . He 's more vocal , and he 's a captain now . I guess everything was sort of put into motion that day . And I know one thing , we all respect Allan . \"  This unselfish son of a coach , whose natural instinct was to blend into the background behind Patrick Ewing and then Latrell Sprewell , has finally found his place in the universe of basketball , settling in next to the elite of the league .  \" Everyone wants to talk about the Shot , \" Coach Jeff Van Gundy said . \" But he was struggling in that game until the fourth quarter . It showed his maturity to go from struggling to making a big shot when it matters most . From that moment on , he started to separate himself from the other good shooting guards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a struggle for Houston , much like it is for anyone shy in nature to find the courage to stand up and be seen in front of an audience . Often , he would disappear at the Garden like a stand-in on the stage , giving way to the takeover mentality of John Starks or Ewing . This was what the Knicks got for a $56 million investment ? A wallflower ?  It was a difficult initiation for Houston . He had left Detroit for a fast-paced city that did not seem to fit his loping ways , for a coach who did not trust him to deliver in a big situation and for a team that was heavy on ego he did not possess .  \" When I came here , there was n't a red carpet rolled out for me , \" Houston said . \" But you know , I would n't have had it any other way . I was pushed . \"  Instead of giving up his milk money to the bullying Knicks , Houston pushed back , pushed harder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of discovery was not already under way when Houston delivered in Miami , but that moment pressed the accelerator .  If he had missed , who knows ? He might have slipped back . The franchise might have been dismantled . His coach would have most likely been fired , and the ramifications might have left this most sensitive of players in mental disarray .  Instead , the shot fell , and the Knicks ' star-aligned run through the playoffs and into the finals began . Houston was there the whole way . If there is any statistic that reveals just how much impact Houston has on his team , it 's the record of the Knicks during the playoffs last year when he led the team in scoring : 5-0 .  \" To me , scorers , when they score big and they lose , they 're not doing their job as superstars , \" said the Knicks ' assistant coach Don Chaney , who was the head coach at Detroit during Houston 's 1993-94 rookie season . \" If you make the players around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . If you get big numbers and no one else is scoring , the chances are that one man is not going to beat anybody . \"  Even as stardom has become as comfortable a fit as a favorite chair for Houston , even as the label of captain that Van Gundy asked him to wear on the team plane trip to training camp in Charleston , S.C. , seems to suit him now , Houston is just as unselfish as before . But there is a difference between deferring with a pedestrian pass in the perimeter world he used to live in as the shooter , and creating opportunities for others with an aggressive drive to the basket .  \" He 's still a great shooter , but you see him being so assertive now , \" said Grant Hill , Houston 's former Detroit teammate . \" I was watching the playoffs , and I think that 's the biggest change . He 's driving to the basket and kicking the ball out to his teammates . He 's a complete player . \"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if it was the Shot or maybe just the accumulation of his run in the playoffs and his experience on the Olympic team this summer , but if that shot is what catapulted him , great , \" Van Gundy said .  Whatever it is , Houston has sprung to life in the early stages of this season . After a career of shooting in the high 30 's and low 40 's before January , Houston has opened the season hitting at a rate of 53 percent and averaging 22.4 points a game .  \" I ca n't say the Shot made Allan Houston , because he was a player prior to that , but it really , to me , took him to another level in terms of superstardom , \" Chaney said . \" I think now Allan believes he can score on anyone in the league . And I think , late in a game , he knows he can make any basket . \"  He has seen proof , sitting alone in front of a VCR .  \" I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston said . \" This is my sixth year in the league and I went through a lot to get to that shot . But if people want to consider it that , fine . To me , it 's not a turning point or a beginning . The bottom line is , the shot went in . \"  http : //www.nytimes.com \n",

LaVar Arrington got to him first , Jeremiah Trotter a split second after , and the forces of man and nature pushed Favre 's left knee out from under him , twisted and exposed , helpless in a way that has ended so many football careers .  Favre , the Green Bay Packers quarterback , hobbled to his feet , teary-eyed according to some , and was soon scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging exam that could have revealed any number of injuries . The film showed a slightly sprained lateral collateral ligament , an injury he could continue to play on . Then , it showed something else : tendons and cartilage as strong and as thick as telephone cables .  \" The doctors were amazed , \" Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman said Friday . \" The ligaments were that of a 22-year-old swimmer . \"  It could be called luck if Favre , 33 , had n't cheated the fates so many times during his 12-year career -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive his streak of 165 starts at a position that may be the most hazardous in sports .

In an era when so many of his peers have been knocked out of the game -- Steve Young and Troy Aikman , in particular -- Favre has continued to thrive in the face of linemen who grow bigger every year .  \" There have been times when injuries could have kept me out , and there have been times when injuries should have kept me out , \" said Favre , who was born in Gulfport , Miss . \" But as my mom always said , I 'm hardheaded . \"  The only N.F.L. player to win three Most Valuable Player awards , Favre is poised to wrap his hands around a fourth .

His body remains sturdy at an age when many other athletes are breaking down . And considering his early years in the league , that is somewhat of an anomaly .  Favre once played the role of good-time Charlie to the hilt . He drank . He was hospitalized in 1996 for an addiction to the painkiller Vicodin . He sometimes arrived at practice with his hair a disheveled reminder of the night 's activity . It was the stuff of burnout , of Mickey Mantle looking back and wishing he had treated his body better .  Had he continued down that path , Favre said , \" There is no question that , if I was sitting here , it would be in a different role , or not as good , or not here .  \" Or not living . \"  Favre , following terms of his drug rehabilitation , agreed not to drink alcohol for two years . He switched to taking non-narcotic and nonsteroidal drugs .

And it did n't include some of the things that were pulling him down from that side of the fence . \"  Since joining the team in a trade in 1992 , Favre 's constancy with the Packers is one of the few stable things in the constantly changing league . His primary receiver has changed from Sterling Sharpe to Antonio Freeman to Bill Schroeder to Donald Driver . Sherman is his third coach , after Mike Holmgren and Ray Rhodes ( though , as Sherman pointed out , the offense Favre has run is virtually unchanged . )  The league has expanded , teams have moved to new cities , and divisions have been realigned , but Favre continues to sink his roots deeper into the town that lives for green-and-yellow Sundays .

Favre seems comfortable with the idea of one day fading from the spotlight . Retirement can stop Favre 's starting streak , and he has said that he is entertaining the thought . While he has n't picked a year to retire , many people , including Sherman , believe that Favre can play into his 40 's . He has indicated that he wo n't .  He can see a quieter , simpler life , free from being a Sunday fixture , from being the guy who always punches the clock and gets up from the devastating tackle .  \" I will miss the game , \" Favre said . \" If you retire at the top of the game , maybe it 's because you 're tired of the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go through this every day .

            "@@3001041  One jump on a practice rink changed the face of the United States figure skating team Sunday , ushering 17-year-old Emily Hughes into the Olympics . She will replace Michelle Kwan , who was forced to pull out with a groin injury , leaving Sasha Cohen as the only realistic candidate to uphold the United States ' medal hopes .  When 25-year-old Kwan told skating officials here early Sunday that she would have to withdraw , ending her last hopes for a gold medal , Hughes and her family were eating a sushi dinner Saturday night at Daruma of Tokyo , her favorite Japanese restaurant , near their home in Great Neck , N.Y .  It was the same restaurant where Emily 's older sister Sarah first met Kwan -- and got her autograph -- after Kwan performed at Nassau Coliseum some seven years ago . The restaurant 's menu now lists a Sarah Gold Roll , which honors the surprise gold medal Sarah won in Salt Lake City in 2002 . Kwan finished a disappointing third four years ago , after winning silver in 1998 .  Kwan said Saturday that she was thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily 's father , John Hughes , the caller ID gave away that it was from United States Figure Skating Association officials . He announced that bit of news to the table before answering . After a brief conversation , he gave the thumbs-up sign and passed the phone to Emily .  The Hugheses were asked not to say anything for 12 hours .  \" They told us we could n't tell anyone , so we had to leave the restaurant , \" Hughes said via conference call from her home . \" It 's a little hard to be quiet because we were so excited . \"  Alongside Emily at dinner were Sarah , John and Amy Hughes as well as Emily 's agent , Art Kaminsky , and his wife . On their way out , Kaminsky said they stopped briefly to look at a television showing the start of the pairs short program , which kicked off Olympic figure skating Saturday .  Back in Turin , Kwan 's withdrawal began what turned into a disappointing day for the United States . The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the men 's halfpipe but did not win a medal in the men 's downhill , short-track speedskating or the men 's luge singles . Its total of three medals after two days of competition matched the total in Salt Lake City .  Kwan arrived here full of hope that she could compete for the gold medal that was missing from her Olympic career . A previous groin injury had put that in doubt , forcing her to withdraw from the national championships in January . She was named to the Olympic team after petitioning for a spot , then proving that she was healthy by performing for skating officials about two weeks ago .  But in her first practice here , Kwan landed badly while attempting a triple flip and United States team doctors said she pulled a groin muscle . This one ended her Olympic career .  Kwan tried to hold back tears during her news conference , but halfway through , she cried .  \" I 've learned it 's not about the gold , \" Kwan said . \" It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrets . I tried my hardest and if I do n't win the gold , it 's O.K. I 'll be happy . \"  NBC was excited enough about another Hughes in the Olympics to have a camera crew at her house early Sunday morning in the middle of a snowstorm .  Hughes remained grounded in Long Island because of the snow , but she said there was no rush to get to Turin because the short program is not until Feb. 21 . In fact , Kaminsky said , Emily would probably attend school as usual Monday , if it is not canceled because of the weather .  Emily is a much longer shot to win a medal than her sister was . The most obvious point of comparison is that Sarah finished third at the national championships in 2002 before winning the gold at Salt Lake City ; Emily finished third at the nationals last month before temporarily losing her spot on the Olympic team to Kwan .  But the program Sarah performed in Salt Lake City was more difficult than Cohen 's or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slutskaya won the silver and Cohen place fourth in 2002 . ) The level of difficulty in Emily 's program this year does not approach Cohen 's .  At her best , particularly under the new scoring system -- which leaves much less room for discretion on the technical side -- Hughes could contend for a spot in the top 10 . It is her first season competing on the senior level .  At nationals , Hughes fell attempting a triple jump and completed only four in her long program . The top skaters often land as many as seven , some in combination with double or triple jumps . The third member of the United States team , 16-year-old Kimmie Meissner , completed seven triples in her performance at the nationals , but still finished far behind Cohen when the points were totaled .  \" At nationals , when I finished third and made the world championships team , I was just so excited with that because it was such a big step up from last year , \" Hughes said . \" For me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great dream so far . \"  But the skater who now has a chance to step out of Kwan 's considerable shadow is Cohen , who enters her second Olympics as a medal contender . At last year 's world championships , Cohen finished second to Slutskaya , who is the favorite here .  Cohen reacted graciously to Kwan 's withdrawal . \" I was a little bit shocked , \" she said . \" I know how tough it is to come back from an injury . It 's great that she tried and I 'm sorry that it did n't work out . \"  Cohen , 21 , skated a flawless short program in Salt Lake City , only to fall doing a triple-triple combination in the long program .  Kwan 's disappointment in 2002 was even more acute . She was the favorite , but fell in her long program and finished third . It was the second straight Games in which she failed to come through with the gold . In 1998 , she finished second to another teenager from the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying for a third Olympics . At last year 's world championships , she finished fourth in her first exposure to the new scoring system , which puts a premium on the kind of difficult elements she was not doing .  Her intensified efforts to add those elements , Kwan said , led to her injury-plagued season . A hip injury knocked her out of several international competitions and the Grand Prix series . A groin injury in December kept her from the nationals , an event she had won a record-tying nine times .  To petition successfully onto the Olympic team , Kwan had to skate her short and long programs for a team of observers Jan. 27 at a rink in Artesia , Calif . She performed so well that Bob Horen , chairman of the United States Figure Skating Association 's international committee , said he believed Kwan could win the gold .  But those hopes crashed during Kwan 's first practice in Turin . When she was forced to withdraw , Kwan advised Hughes not to forget to enjoy herself .  \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \" I 'm sure she 'll have a great time and I 'm sure she 'll make the country proud . \"  Kwan said she would head home immediately . \" I do n't want to be a distraction , \" she said .

            "@@3001141  Even if Mayor David N. Dinkins can reassure investors that New York City 's finances are well managed , the city will probably pay sharply higher interest costs the next time it tries to raise money in the bond market , financial experts say .  Mr. Dinkins will face an important test on Thursday , they say , when the administration is to release a revised financial plan , showing how it will begin to grapple with a worsening economy and growing budget deficits .  In the unlikely event that the city 's financial monitors and the credit rating agencies find the plan inadequate , the city could have trouble selling the $950 million in bonds that it plans to issue next month , bond traders and analysts say .  But even if Mr. Dinkins passes this test -- and he has already taken a series of increasingly harsh steps in the last few days to reassure the financial community -- the traders and analysts say the city 's credibility with investors remains damaged from an earlier period of confusing signals and commitments . ' There Is Skepticism '  \" I think the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bond broker and president of Titus &; Donnelly . \" It is a matter of what they are going to have to pay . \"  One underwriter of city bond issues , who asked not to be identified , observed , \" There is skepticism about the city 's sincerity , its ability to deal with the budget gaps in a fiscally responsible way . \"  Already the City Comptroller , Elizabeth Holtzman , is forecasting that a $1.3 billion short-term note sale later this month will cost the city $7 million more than previously planned this year , because of rising interest costs .  The city could be forced to pay tens of millions of dollars in higher interest costs on its next sale of long-term bonds , even after taking into account overall changes in interest rates , analysts said .  City officials say they are aware of the concerns of investors and planning an extended information campaign to convince them that the city is capable of managing its affairs even in the face of an economic downturn .  \" If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the markets at a reasonable price , \" Ms. Holtzman said . \" The fact that the administration knows it will have to run that gantlet is an important discipline . \" Bond Sale Postponed  The city 's Budget Director , Philip R. Michael , said the administration was focusing on those concerns as it made a major effort to prepare what is usually a routine revision of its financial plan .  Because of concern over the next bond sale , Mr. Dinkins and Ms. Holtzman agreed to postpone it by a month , until December , to give them more time to reach out to investors .  The city is planning to go ahead with a sale of $1.3 billion in short-term notes later this month . But rather than holding an auction , as it has in the last few years , it will negotiate the interest rate with the city 's underwriters .  Aides to Miss Holtzman said the city 's strategy was governed by the concern that it had a complicated story to tell investors . Since-tax exempt notes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story is easier to convey . Unsettled Municipal Bond Market  Similarly , they said , when a note is a known commodity , auctions often produce lower interest costs . But when sales are large or complicated , or the market is in flux , negotiations may allow the city to sell bonds paying slightly less interest . City officials are hoping that with few other note sales scheduled this month , the notes will do well -- and thus ease the way for the bond sale next month .  One backdrop to the city 's worsening credit picture is an unsettled municipal bond market , in which investors are forsaking riskier investments in cities with problems in favor of safer , higher-rated issues . This has driven up interest costs for cities with problems .  Another is New York City 's special place in the bond market . It is the largest borrower in the municipal bond market , it is home to much of the municipal bond industry and its brush with bankruptcy in the 1970 's was one of the seminal events in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  During one confusing week in early October -- in which Mr. Dinkins agreed to a 5.5 percent salary increase for teachers , announced a plan to hire thousands of police officers and warned that 15,000 city workers might have to be laid off -- the price of New York City bonds fell sharply , and the yields rose . Cut in Rating Is Possible  The administration 's confusing signals confounded the bond market . They came two weeks after the city completed its most successful bond sale , in which the city had to pay the lowest interest rates since Mr. Dinkins took office . Bear Stearns , the lead underwriter , either lost money or narrowly broke even on the deal . Underwriters , usually a group of investment banks , agree before a bond sale to buy the whole issue and then try to resell it at a profit .  After the bond prices fell , Standard &; Poor 's put the city 's $13 billion of outstanding bonds on its Credit Watch list , and warned that if the city did not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rating drop from A to BBB -- the lowest that is still called \" investment grade \" by the rating services , just above what would be , in effect , \" junk bonds . \"  In the next few weeks , as the administration rushed to reassure the financial community by cutting spending , warning of as many as 35,000 layoffs and pressuring unions for lower wage settlements , bond prices stopped falling . But they remained close to the high levels of early October . Lower Return  On Friday , long-term city bonds were yielding a return of about 8.6 percent , after going as high as 8.8 percent in some transactions , traders said . Traders said New York City bonds were already trading as if they had a BBB rating or lower . In early October , they were selling to yield 8.25 percent . A bond 's yield is what the investor who buys it gets on it . This can be more or less than the interest paid by the borrower . If the yield is higher , the buyer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bond . If the yield is lower , the buyer will pay more than the face value of the bond .  One way of measuring the city 's declining credit is to compare the difference between the yields on New York City bonds and the yields on other municipal bonds today and when the city last sold bonds , on Sept. 14 .  In September , the city sold 21-year bonds with a yield of 8.05 percent , while other similar A-rated municipal bonds were yielding 7.65 percent , according to the Delphis Hanover Corporation . Sensitive to the City  Today , New York City bonds are trading at a yield of 8.6 percent , while similar bonds are trading to yield 7.5 percent . So by this standard the city 's interest costs increased by seven-tenths of 1 percent .  That translates into $7,000 in extra interest costs each year for each $1 million in bonds sold . Assuming the city paid the same extra interest for an entire year 's borrowing of about $4 billion , and all the bonds matured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra interest costs . City bonds have varying terms ranging up to 30 years .  Since many bond traders and investors live or at least work in New York City , they are especially sensitive to the political and social currents in the city , from homelessness to dirty streets and from fear of crime to City Hall skirmishes .  \" The markets like predictability and routine , \" said Alan J. Proctor , executive director of the state Financial Control Board . \" The environment of the last month was unpredictability . The administration is now making extraordinary efforts to show that it is going about a predictable process . \" ' Very Blunt Instrument '  He said the \" difference between the first week of October and now is like the difference between night and day . \"  But Kurt van Kuller , managing director for research at Lebenthal &; Company , said that even if the city takes strong action and keeps its A bond rating from Standard &; Poor 's , the bond market might not react for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" Mr. van Kuller said . \" The way it moves is in big swings . I do n't think that one bit of news will make a difference . \"  And even if the Mayor calms concerns about the city 's management , Mr. van Kuller noted that other problems remain . \" The issue will focus not so much on what is he doing next year , \" he said , \" but on the general problem of resources and the city 's economy . \" \n",

Scattered across the state 's midsection -- in the rolling hills here , the corporate campuses of Princeton , the urban clutter of New Brunswick and elsewhere -- is the world 's largest concentration of companies that create and market prescription drugs , companies whose steady growth and investment have been the envy of other corporations even in recessionary years .  Now , the pharmaceutical industry finds itself under siege from insurers , hospitals , Congress and the Clinton Administration , which calls the containment of health-care costs a major priority in its fight to reduce the Federal deficit . On Friday , the President singled out the industry for criticism , calling its prices \" shocking \" and saying drug companies are spending too much on advertising and lobbying .  In New Jersey , sometimes called the medicine chest of the nation because it is home to the main research arms of 10 of the world 's 18 largest drug companies , the big question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can continue to stand out as models of growth , profitability and , by many measures , community involvement .

That has threatening implications across a region reeling from huge manufacturing job losses , including the impending shutdown of the General Motors assembly plant in Tarrytown , N.Y. , and thousands of layoffs by I.B.M .  In what some analysts call an omen for the industry , Bristol-Myers Squibb said in October that it was cutting 2,000 jobs in its pharmaceutical group , based in Princeton .  New Federal regulations , combined with fierce competition in the industry , \" are going to drive the margins out of the pharmaceutical business over the next five years , \" said Raymond C.

It is completing work on a $20 million molecular neurobiology research center here to develop drugs for Alzheimer 's disease and other disorders .

In Nutley , Hoffmann-La Roche won an award last year from the Environmental Protection Agency , in part for its programs to recycle waste . Other drug makers have been widely cited for volunteer work and for gifts to community programs . ' The Most Admired Industry '  In its current issue , Fortune Magazine calls pharmaceutical makers \" the most admired industry \" in the United States and singles out four New Jersey drug makers for praise : Merck , based in Whitehouse Station , Johnson &; Johnson , Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Schering-Plough Corporation , based in Madison .  Brenda J. Bacon , who is Gov . Jim Florio 's chief of management planning and his top adviser on health-care issues , said , \" We need health-care reform , but not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the Clinton Administration does not want to solve one problem by creating another . \"  The debate over how to contain medical costs is creating political headaches for Mr. Florio and his administration . Although he is a close political ally of Mr. Clinton , the Governor is under pressure from his own state 's pharmaceutical executives to carry their message to Washington .  Ms. Bacon said Mr. Florio planned to meet with top pharmaceutical executives the week of Feb. 14 . She said he would urge them to agree to voluntary limits on price increases for prescription drugs , but only if the same limits were agreed to by the entire pharmaceutical industry . Division on Price Limits  So far , two of the New Jersey companies -- Merck and Hoffman La Roche -- have told state officials they would agree to voluntary limits , in which their prices for drugs already on the market would not be raised above the consumer price index . Others have balked , saying the idea is too broad and leaves them no flexibility in pricing drugs that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug makers were having problems even earlier . Bristol-Myers Squibb , the only major New Jersey pharmaceutical maker that has announced job cuts in recent years , complains about a set of Federal rules made in the Bush Administration requiring pharmaceutical companies to charge Medicaid recipients no more for their drugs than they charge large-volume buyers .  That law has forced some companies to repay large amounts to state Medicaid programs . Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would owe Medicaid $100 million in rebates this year .  The drug companies have been squeezed by a growing reliance on health maintenance organizations , which vigorously negotiated discounts on prescription medications by buying them in bulk . And they have felt pressure from large hospitals and clinics , which have adopted limits on what they will pay for drugs . Convenience or Low Cost  One result has been a rapid increase in the use of generic drugs , which cost far less than their brand-name counterparts , or medications that may require patients to sacrifice convenience for lower costs . For instance , many customers are opting for drugs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , the Clinton Administration said that it would favor a Federal program to buy vaccines en masse for the lowest price possible , and provide them free for school immunization programs .  In a report to the Senate that was bitterly contested by the industry , researchers concluded that several companies that had pledged not to raise their prices faster than the rate of inflation had done so in 1992 .  \" This report adds to the mounting evidence that voluntary price restraints simply do n't work , \" said Sen. David Pryor , an Arkansas Democrat . Among those singled out were Merck and American Home Products . Vast Profits in 1980 's  Despite the mounting economic and political heat , industry analysts say they doubt that the nation 's largest pharmaceutical companies will veer far from the strategies that produced vast profits in the 1980 's .  \" The lifeblood of the industry is new products , \" said Robert Hodgeson , a health care analyst for Cowan and Company in Boston . \" These companies will be looking for efficiencies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \"  That may help New Jersey , which has become a global vortex of drug research .

Thousands refused meals to protest cuts in services . Correction officers went on high alert . The nation 's largest jail complex braced for a riot .  But the explosion of New York City 's nearly 20,000 inmates never happened . The coalition of inmates weakened . The tension dissipated , like a fog lifting . This year , slashings and stabbings by inmates have declined sharply as jail officials herald an era of relative peace and control .  Just as last fall 's prediction of an uprising was overstated , however , this season 's calm masks the daily drumbeat of violence on Rikers . The same volatile ingredients that nearly boiled over six months ago still exist . The number of inmates is rising , the number of officers is declining , and inmate services , including counseling and classes , have been sharply cut .

Albanese , a member of the City Council 's Public Safety Committee . \" I 'm sure the hierarchy of the department gets up every morning and prays that there 's no problems . \"  The mundane daily catalogue of violent incidents is jarring : slicing fights between inmates who store razor blades in their mouths ; vicious , seemingly unprovoked attacks on correction officers by inmates ; officers subduing inmates with their fists .  It is a gauge of the gulf between jail and the free world that such violence persists in an atmosphere touted by officials , and some inmates , as dramatically improved .  \" Before you could n't live in jail , \" said Efaim Torres , a prisoner in a crowded dormitory of metal beds and cold-eyed inmates . \" Now you can go to sleep and not worry . \"  But even with this year 's drop in slashings and stabbings -- 251 for the first quarter compared with 324 for the last three months of 1994 -- the level of violence is considerably higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire year .  This year 's trend , said Eric M. Taylor , the jails ' top officer , is the result of clamping down hard on the inmates -- more frequent weapons searches , computer analyses for pinpointing violence-prone areas , and added restraints on the most dangerous .  Yet the long-term trend continues . The inmates are more violent and better armed , reflecting the tenor of the street . The jails are increasingly strapped for resources , reflecting the state of the city government . Logging the Violence Single-Edge Razor : Weapon of Choice  The internal daily logs of the city 's jails read like a script of violence that ebbs and flows between seasons and sometimes between days .  Two weeks ago , in a seemingly typical incident , a correction officer at the James A. Thomas Center was punched by an inmate , \" knocked to the floor and rendered unconscious , \" according to an internal report . When officers tried to strip-search the inmate he attacked again . \" Officers exchanged punches with the inmate , \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a razor from his pants pocket . \"  \" Inmate refused to comply with the orders to release the weapon , \" the report said , \" so the captain kicked at the inmate 's hand until the inmate released the razor blade . \"  The previous day , three inmates at the Thomas jail had been stabbed by four fellow inmates .  \" We 're just a reflection of the street , \" said Ralph McGrane , an assistant chief of the Department of Correction . \" People get into fights over basketball and softball games on the street . It 's no different here . \"  In that same jail , officers conducted a search on Jan. 20 and within three and a half hours found 59 razors and 11 homemade knives . Two months later , an inmate directed officers to a telephone where they unscrewed the mouthpiece and found a stash of 40 razors . During February and March , officers recovered 1,436 weapons from all of the city 's jails .  \" The single-edged razor , that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security officer on Rikers Island . \" It 'll cut you open like a hot knife going through butter . These guys have more weapons than they do on the street . \"  To catch smuggled weapons , visitors are searched before entering the jails and employees pass through metal detectors , or magnometers . But in October , when Correction Department investigators conducted a surprise check of the staff entrances at nine Rikers jails , they found the magnometers were not on at three of the jails , according to a report on the examination . At six of the jails , investigators noted , the staff members were not accustomed to regular searches . Officers have since been retrained in security procedures , an official said .  Only the inmates have the weapons in the jails , but the aggression on Rikers goes both ways , and beyond .  The department is investigating a March 25 incident in which a Rikers pharmacy assistant , Vincent James , was apparently mistaken for an inmate on the grounds of the island as he arrived for work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a statement released by Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Employees Union , Mr. James said the captain \" took her nightstick from her belt and struck me three times perpendicularly directly into my abdomen . \"  Even after Mr. James identified himself , the statement said , one officer \" put a thick glove on his right hand and forcibly held my face with his gloved hand . He pressed my face in a downward position . I felt as though my head was about to be pushed through my chest cavity . \" Mr. James was eventually released but told by the officers to remain silent about the incident , the statement said .  The logs report daily conflicts between inmates and officers . Often officers respond by punching inmates .  On April 4 , an inmate assaulted a correction officer and the officer \" responded with several punches to the face and body . \"  On April 5 , two inmates \" refused to cease fighting \" and when officers \" employed body holds , the noted inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \"  On April 8 , when an officer told an inmate to hang up a telephone \" the inmate refused and pushed the officer in the chest area . \"  \" The officer responded with one punch to the facial area \" and then put the inmate in a cell with the help of other officers .  Jonathan Chasan , a Legal Aid Society lawyer , who has brought several successful lawsuits charging brutality by officers at Rikers , said officers are supposed to use the least injurious form of restraint necessary , but the guideline is often ignored . He said the department lacks adequate internal monitors on staff actions . A 6th Borough A Neighborhood Of Jails  Rikers Island is like the city 's sixth borough , an island between the Bronx and Queens , populated by the accused and the convicted .

Women march to lunch singing about bettering their lives . Searches for contraband turn up \" basically excessive clothing , \" said the warden , Jannie Poullard .  More places are like the James A. Thomas Center , which looks every inch a jail . Its long , narrow cell blocks with 75 cells apiece stacked three tiers high reverberate with the dull murmurs of idle inmates and the sharp clang of metal gates .

On a recent tour of the jails , arranged for The New York Times after six months of requests , signs of morale boosters were evident . They range from the substantive -- a new emphasis on cleanliness -- to the symbolic -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani now visits injured officers in the hospital -- to the simplistic -- the staff entrance of the Otis Bantum Correctional Center displays the \" 11 Commandments for an Enthusiastic Team . \"  Commandment 5 : \" Speak positively about each other and about your organization at every opportunity . \" Commandment 11 : \" Have fun . \" Budget Squeeze Economy Moves Anger Inmates  Just as violence is an immediate threat to inmates and staff , the continual budget squeeze threatens the equilibrium of the jails .  Last fall 's food strikes were prompted by reports of planned reductions in classes , counseling service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in \" time to 9 P.M. from 11 P.M. , all changes driven by the city 's budget crisis . Only the change in the lock-in time , a volatile issue among inmates , was dropped .  For next year , the mayor 's budget proposal calls for a $56 million decrease in the department 's current $761 million budget and cuts of 749 officers and 228 civilian employees .  No correction officers have been hired since 1991 , and the number has fallen by more than 1,000 in the last two years , to 9,529 . Meanwhile , annual admission to city jails is rising , 18 percent in the last year .  With the officer-to-inmate ratio diminished , said Stan Israel , the president of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association , inmates , and particularly leaders of jailhouse gangs , have become more powerful . \" The price of peace is to let the gangs flourish , and I think one day they are going to pay the price , \" Mr. Israel said .  The strain is obvious . The city is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The overtime budget last year was $88 million and this year is $89 million , with a planned decline to $72 million next year .  \" These are guys who are doing a thankless job , \" said William Booth , the chairman of the Board of Correction , which oversees the department . \" When they have to work double and triple shifts their efficiency goes down . They ca n't be as alert or effective . \"  Inmate services have been cut sharply . About 900 drug treatment beds were eliminated by the Giuliani administration in the last year , although some are now being restored , and even larger jails , with more than 1,000 inmates , have just one inmate counselor each .  At the Anna M. Kross jail , inmates in a crowded dormitory said that other than one hour of outdoor recreation early each morning , they are locked in the dorm and the adjacent television room all day , sleeping , listening to cassette players , talking . They said they even eat meals on their beds .  At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee , in jail on weapons charges , lives with a group of inmates on a clean , sunny cell block that has regular meetings to discuss substance abuse and self-esteem problems . The inmates set rules for the living area and even vote before switching the television channel . While his cell block is peaceful and productive , he knows much of the jail is not and that idleness can breed unrest .  \" We understand that a lot of the cuts are for budget reasons , \" Mr. Lee said , \" but you ca n't just lock up a lot of people and not give them anything to do . \" More With Less Seeking Ways To Cut Expenses  The correction problem has fallen to Michael P. Jacobson , who was appointed acting commissioner in January , after Anthony J. Schembri resigned during an inquiry into whether he met the city 's residency requirement .  It 's among the most difficult budgeting tasks in city government . The department has little say over the size of its population . The Police Department controls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rising . The courts and district attorneys control the flow out of the jails by disposing of cases .  But to meet its tight budget for next year , the department is counting on the city to cut the average time in jail for accused criminals by 6 days , to 40 days .  Speeding up the city 's criminal case system has long been a concern of various agencies , and there has been some success at doing so in recent years . But without significant success soon to reduce the jails ' average daily population , the department could face even deeper cuts in staff . Mr. Jacobson fears that could threaten security .  \" I do n't think we can afford to lose much more uniform staff with the current population , \" said Mr. Jacobson , who is also the probation commissioner and a former Dinkins administration budget official .  The department is reviewing all of its operations , searching for ways to save money . Paradoxically , that may mean restoring some inmate services , like drug treatment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing overtime costs , Mr. Jacobson said .  He said the department will use 600 new jail beds , due to open in the summer , as drug treatment centers , replacing two-thirds of the treatment beds cut over the last year . Mr. Jacobson said running the new jail units as drug treatment centers requires fewer officers , and will save money .  Some changes save money and reduce violence . For example , a new telephone system ends inmate calls after six minutes , cutting down on fights over phones and saving a projected $2 million in telephone bills .  In making some changes , the department is likely to face a fight from inmate advocates . Officials want relief from court orders and consent decrees that govern all aspects of jail life , from the schedule for window washing to the time inmates are locked in for the night .  \" My concern is they might attempt to undo 15 or 20 years of work aimed at insuring the humane treatment of inmates in city jails , \" said John Boston , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \" People who are incarcerated should be treated humanely . If the city says it does n't have enough money to treat them humanely , they should have less people in jail . \"  One challenge is expected to come when the department seeks to increase jail space by housing sentenced inmates in a part of an old jail that a judge has already found unfit for detainees awaiting trial .  Another court ruling likely to be challenged requires a full medical exam , including chest X-rays , on any new inmate , even if the inmate is re-entering jail after having left a few days before .  But rules more basic to the operation of the jails are to be reviewed , including staffing levels and other security matters .  Mr. Jacobson said the city is not trying to evade constitutional responsibilities , but it simply wants to operate the jails within its means .  \" We 're not saying that 's it , we 're just going to feed them corn dogs , \" Mr. Jacobson said .  Yet others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that a new round of cuts and adjustments could revive unrest , threatening what he called Rikers Island 's \" relative quiet . \"  \" I hope it continues , \" Mr. Booth said , \" but I do n't think it will . \"  Graph : \" KEEPING TRACK : Violence at Rikers \" shows slashings and stabbings by inmates of other inmates from 1992 to 1995 .

            "@@3001441 @ @ @ New York City police officer has been charged with brutally attacking a Haitian immigrant inside a Brooklyn station house last weekend , officials announced last night , adding that the essential information used against the officer was provided by one of his colleagues at the 70th Precinct .  Officer Charles Schwarz was named in an indictment handed up by a Brooklyn grand jury yesterday afternoon , as was Officer Justin A. Volpe , who was charged earlier this week with torturing the immigrant , Abner Louima , after he was arrested in a scuffle outside a nightclub .  Police Commissioner Howard Safir declined to discuss the specifics of the indictment or to detail what role Officer Schwarz is accused of playing . But law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they thought that Officer Schwarz restrained Mr. Louima in the station house bathroom while Officer Volpe shoved a toilet plunger 's wooden handle up the man 's rectum , causing critical injury , and then into his mouth , breaking teeth .  One high-ranking law enforcement official said Officer Schwarz , 32 , who lives on Staten Island , faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and first-degree assault .  Announcing the indictment at a news conference yesterday , Mr. Safir said Officer Schwarz , a six-year veteran , had received a 15-day suspension in 1992 \" for striking somebody in the face . \"  Officer Schwarz surrendered to internal affairs detectives last night . \" He is innocent of these charges , but unfortunately he will have to go through this lengthy and embarrassing process before he is vindicated , \" his lawyer , Stephen Worth , said .  Commissioner Safir and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised the courage of the unnamed officer who provided information against Officer Schwarz , and said his cooperation put the lie to what the Commissioner called \" the myth of the blue wall of silence . \" Investigators agreed that more officers in the Flatbush precinct were stepping forward to cooperate . Other officers may be charged as well .  Some community leaders have said that while the current case was singularly repulsive , it reflected a broader problem in how the police under the Giuliani administration treat minority-group residents . To underscore that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the Rev. Al Sharpton , a Democratic mayoral candidate , plan to hold a protest rally today in front of the 70th Precinct station house . \" We see the 70th Precinct as the symbol of institutional neglect of the city to deal with police brutality , \" said Mr. Sharpton , who lives in the precinct .  But Mayor Giuliani defended both his Police Department and his administration . \" The communities of the city have to also not fall into the excessive anti-police rhetoric that some people would lead them to , \" he said , \" because that drives the police further away . \"  Commissioner Safir met yesterday with Haitian community leaders , some of whom do not endorse Mr. Sharpton 's involvement in the planned protest rally . The Commissioner 's intent was to explain the Police Department 's stand against police brutality and to encourage leaders to hold a peaceful protest , Deputy Police Commissioner Marilyn Mode said . \" We want everyone to keep calm heads , \" she said .  Apart from the political salvos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . Investigators from the office of Charles J. Hynes , the Brooklyn District Attorney , obtained court-ordered warrants , and were prepared to search the station-house lockers of police officers suspected of involvement in the attack . Meanwhile , detectives from the Police Department 's Internal Affairs Bureau dredged the sewers outside the station house , looking for the plunger thought to have been used in the assault . They recovered more knives , a machete , some bullets and some sticks of wood . While several of those items could be a toilet plunger 's handle , a police official said last night that investigators were not satisfied that they had the assault weapon .  The case of Abner Louima was slow in coming to light -- reports of an assault on him on Saturday did not become public until Tuesday -- but his account of torture , related from his hospital bed , has dominated news reports this week .  With each passing day , new details emerge -- some contradictory , some revelatory -- about the chain of events inside a drab police station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , a night security guard from Jamaica , Queens , was arrested after a scuffle between the police and revelers leaving a Flatbush Avenue nightclub where a Haitian band had been playing . The brawling occurred in a precinct in which some officers and some Haitian residents share a growing distrust of one another .  During the fighting , witnesses say , a police officer handed his gun belt to a partner and began exchanging blows with Mr. Louima . Whether that officer was Justin Volpe remains unclear . Investigators said Mr. Louima knocked Officer Volpe to the ground ; the officer 's lawyer , Marvyn Kornberg , said Mr. Louima struck his client in the face , and that Officer Volpe and four other officers later went to the hospital with minor injuries .  Investigators said they are reviewing the recordings of radio communications between the precinct dispatcher and officers after Mr. Louima 's arrest . He has said that two police officers , neither of whom was Officer Volpe , stopped twice to beat him while taking him to the station house .  According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators believe that Officer Volpe took charge of Mr. Louima there . \" He hit me , \" the official quoted the officer as saying . \" This collar is mine . \"  Then Officer Volpe and Officer Schwarz took Mr. Louima into the bathroom , law enforcement officials said . As Officer Schwarz beat and held Mr. Louima , they say , Officer Volpe assaulted the man with the wooden handle . Mr. Louima said one of the two officers said , \" This is Giuliani time , not Dinkins time , \" a reference to David N. Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's predecessor , who was often at odds with the rank-and-file police .  Officer Volpe then brought Mr. Louima , still handcuffed , to the station house 's holding cell , investigators said . Stuart London , the lawyer for Officer Thomas Bruder , Officer Volpe 's partner that night , said that his client went into the cell and removed the handcuffs .  Investigators said that the precinct called for an ambulance for Mr. Louima at 6:01 A.M. , more than an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ambulance arrived about 6:25 .  But the ambulance did not leave the station house until 7:58 , more than 90 minutes after arriving , as paramedics waited for police officers , as required , to escort them as they took Mr. Louima to the hospital .  Mr. Louima was immediately listed in critical condition at Coney Island Hospital , with a tear to his colon , a laceration to his bladder and abrasions to his mouth . Doctors said that a blunt instrument had apparently been shoved into his rectum , and that it would take months for him to recover from his injuries . Yesterday afternoon he was transferred to the intensive care unit at the Brooklyn Hospital Center .  Police officials dropped the charges against Mr. Louima on Wednesday , and on Thursday ordered a shake-up at the 70th Precinct , in part to encourage officers to come forward with information . The two top commanders were removed , a desk sergeant was suspended and nine officers were placed on desk duties .  While denouncing the brutality in the Louima case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an isolated matter , far removed from the dedication of a majority of the police force 's 38,000 members . They lavished praise on the unnamed officer who provided information essential to the case .  \" He put decency and the law and concern for other human beings above misplaced loyalty , \" the Mayor said . In acknowledgment of the risk that the officer took , the Commissioner said , \" We are taking steps to protect him . \"  Still , Mr. Louima 's account that one attacker boasted of a license to brutalize under the Giuliani administration continued to haunt the Mayor , no matter how vehemently he portrayed it as ludicrous . Two of his most vociferous political opponents , Mr. Sharpton and former Mayor Dinkins , who are not usually political allies , ended a visit to Mr. Louima 's hospital bedside yesterday morning with a joint attack on the Mayor . Mr. Dinkins said the Giuliani administration 's aggressive approach to law enforcement , typified by its quality-of-life crackdown , encourages officers to treat residents in a brusque manner approaching harassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good and honest and fair-minded , that wo n't be a problem for him or her , \" Mr. Dinkins said . \" But for those police officers who are inclined to step over the line , it 's real dangerous , because they think that it is sanctioned to behave as they wish . \"  On the other hand , Ruth W. Messinger , the likely Democratic challenger to Mr. Giuliani in the November election , praised the Mayor 's handling of the case . In an interview on CNN , she said Mr. Giuliani 's response was \" right on target . \"  At Club Rendez-Vous , where Mr. Louima 's ordeal began , clubgoers held a candlelight vigil last night and made plans to take part in today 's protest at the precinct station .  The same band that played on Tuesday night , the Phantoms , played last night , but to a decidedly smaller crowd .  \" I think we have to go on and show that we are still a community , \" said Serge Demorcery , a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . \"  King Kino , the lead singer of the Phantoms , said : \" We want to show that we are civilized people . We live here , we are taxpayers and we have to go on with our lives . \"  Diagram : \" A CLOSER LOOK : Inside the 70th Precinct Station House \" The approximate layout of the station house where officials say Abner Louima was attacked last weekend . The main room is a large open space with about a 20-foot high ceiling . 1 . About 4:50 A.M. last Saturday , Mr. Louima is brought into the 70th Precinct station house in Flatbush .
